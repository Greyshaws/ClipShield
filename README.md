![PasteGuard Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b8e819-262c-45bb-bc08-a0d01f813d60)

[**PasteGuard**](https://medium.com/@gracious09/address-poisoning-in-defi-a-case-study-of-the-florence-finance-exploit-87c7047a8806) is a lightweight, offline tool that protects crypto users from **address poisoning attacks** — a growing scam tactic where attackers trick users into pasting fake wallet addresses that look nearly identical to legitimate ones. PasteGuard monitors your clipboard in real-time and alerts you when a suspicious or lookalike address is detected, giving you an extra layer of safety for every transaction.

> 🔒 **Your clipboard is sacred. PasteGuard keeps it clean.**

## 🧠 What is Address Poisoning?

Address poisoning is a subtle but highly effective scam where attackers send transactions from a wallet address to poison a victim's transaction history. This wallet address closely mimics the pattern of a legitimate address. Victims often copy this lookalike from previous transactions, unknowingly sending funds to the wrong wallet.
