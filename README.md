**ClipShield** is a lightweight, offline tool that protects crypto users from **address poisoning attacks** — a growing scam tactic where attackers trick users into copying fake wallet addresses that look nearly identical to legitimate ones. ClipShield monitors your clipboard in real-time and alerts you when a newly copied address closely resembles one you've copied before, giving you an extra layer of safety for every transaction.

## 🧠 What is Address Poisoning?

Address poisoning is a subtle but highly effective scam where attackers send transactions from a wallet address to poison a victim's transaction history. This wallet address closely mimics the pattern of a legitimate address. Victims often copy this lookalike from previous transactions, unknowingly sending funds to the wrong wallet.
